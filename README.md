# üö¶ Smart Traffic Management with Hyperledger Fabric üöÄ
TrafficTracker is a blockchain-based traffic management system built using Hyperledger Fabric. This project uses a consortium of four organizations to ensure transparency, efficiency, and trust in handling vehicle registrations, traffic violations, and accident reports.

## üåê Project Overview
TrafficTracker leverages Hyperledger Fabric to create a secure and transparent supply chain of information related to traffic management. The system consists of four key organizations: MVD (Motor Vehicle Department), Traffic Management Authority, Law Enforcement, and the Insurance Company. It ensures data privacy and access control through private data collections.

## üèõÔ∏è Organizations and Their Roles
### 1. MVD (Motor Vehicle Department)
Responsibilities:
- Register and manage vehicle information.
- Validate traffic violation reports received from the Traffic Management Authority.
- Issue fines to vehicles based on validated traffic violations.
Data Access:
- Shares a private data collection with the Traffic Management Authority for secure communication.
### 2. Traffic Management Authority
Responsibilities:
- Create and submit traffic violation reports to the MVD.
- Generate accident reports and share them with Law Enforcement.
Data Access:
- Maintains a private data collection with the MVD for sharing traffic violation reports.
### 3. Law Enforcement
Responsibilities:
- Access accident reports created by the Traffic Management Authority.
- Transfer accident report data to the Insurance Company.
Data Access:
- Can read accident reports shared by the Traffic Management Authority.
### 4. Insurance Company
Responsibilities:
- Review accident reports received from Law Enforcement.
- Provide insurance to the affected vehicle based on the accident report details.
Data Access:
- Reads accident reports passed on by Law Enforcement.
